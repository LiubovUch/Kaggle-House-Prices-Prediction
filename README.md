# Kaggle-House-Prices-Prediction

## Overview
This project is a machine learning solution for the **Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** competition. The goal is to predict house sale prices using various features, such as overall quality, square footage, and garage size. The dataset contains both numeric and categorical features, which are analyzed and preprocessed before model training.

## Dataset
The dataset comes from the [Kaggle House Prices competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).  
- **`train.csv`**: Contains house features and the corresponding sale price (`SalePrice`).  
- **`test.csv`**: Contains house features without `SalePrice`, which we need to predict.  

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models
